<h2>Notepad Webapp built on Node.js and MongoDB</h2>


I'm mostly following the tutorial on http://dailyjs.com/tags.html#lmawa

I've changed thing up a bit with the mongoose schema
just out of preference. I'm also adding in user
authentication to add more of my own features in.

To run the app

```
  cd nodepad
  npm install
  node app.js
```

Thanks and Enjoy!
